# Hacksource
Hacksource is a place for Hack Reactor students to find and share the most helpful resources for advancing their software engineering education.

Slack is great for communicating, but it’s no so great for sharing resources that quickly get lost In the shuffle of new posts and giphys. Not only does Hacksource keep resources perfectly organized using meaningful categories and custom tags, it also allows students to upvote, and even bookmark, what they found most helpful so that the “best of the best” resources are also easiest to find.

> “I wish Hacksource had existed for my entire Hack Reactor journey. It made finding the info I needed to understand and solve any coding problem I was facing SO much faster and easier!” - Emilie Hester, co-founder

To get started, follow the Hacksource link provided to you by HR, then simply search for or post resources. Upvote what you find most helpful and bookmark anything you know you’ll want to return to.

> “Hacksource is AMAZING! It’s wonderful to have a place where I can post the resources that’ve most helped me, knowing that they will also be of help to my classmates.” - ^HRR23 Student
